Device Tree Bindings for LED support on X-Powers PMIC

Most of the X-Powers PMICs have integrated battery charger with LED indicator.
The output is open-drain, so the state is either high-Z or output-low. The
driver is a subnode of AXP20X MFD driver, since it uses shared bus with all
other cells.
The LED can be controlled either manually or automatically. Then in automatic
(controlled by the charger) there are two indication modes:

Mode-A
======
- output-low:		Charging
- high-Z		Not charging
- 1Hz flashing:		Abnormal alarm
- 4Hz flashing		Overvoltage alarm

Mode-B
======
- output-low:		Battery full
- high-Z		Not charging
- 1Hz flashing:		Charging
- 4Hz flashing		Overvoltage or abnormal alarm

The control and the mode can be changed from sysfs.

For AXP20X MFD bindings see:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/axp20x.txt

Required properties:
- compatible : Must be "x-powers,axp20x-led"

Supported common LED properties, see ./common.txt for more informationn
- label : See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
- linux,default-trigger : See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
- default-state: See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt

Optional properties:
- x-powers,charger-mode: 0 for Mode-A, 1 for Mode-B
			 If omitted, then the control is set to manual mode.
			 On invalid value, Mode-A is used.


Example:

	axp803: pmic@3a3 {
		compatible = "x-powers,axp803";

		...

		led@0 {
			compatible = "x-powers,axp20x-led";
			status = "okay";

			label = "axp20x:yellow:chgled";
			linux,default-trigger = "timer";
			default-state = "on";
		};
	};

or

	axp803: pmic@3a3 {
		compatible = "x-powers,axp803";

		...

		led@0 {
			compatible = "x-powers,axp20x-led";
			status = "okay";

			label = "axp20x:yellow:chgled";
			x-powers,charger-mode = <1>;
		};
	};
